# TexasHoldEm_Poker

A Texas Hold Em Poker Simulation using Python 2.7 and Pygame, a 2D graphics engine. The IDE is Pycharm.

Running this program requires installing Pygame which can be found at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

This was my term project for a six-week summer course at Pasadena City College called Python Programming. 
It took around a week to complete. 
Challenges included managing the pot, assessing players' hands, and processing player commands (i.e. bet, call, all in, fold).
